## API Routes

The application uses Next.js API routes to interact with Firebase from the backend:

- `POST /api/auth`: User authentication (login/signup)
- `GET /api/auth`: Logout
- `GET /api/todos`: Get all user tasks
- `POST /api/todos`: Create a new task
- `PUT /api/todos/[id]`: Update a task
- `DELETE /api/todos/[id]`: Delete a task
- `DELETE /api/todos/completed`: Delete all completed tasks
- `GET /api/favorites`: Get user's favorite repositories
- `POST /api/favorites`: Add a repository to favorites
- `DELETE /api/favorites`: Remove a repository from favorites
